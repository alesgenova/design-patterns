# Design Patterns

A collections of problems and examples I worked out while following the book [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126) by Eric Freeman and Elizabeth Freeman.

The book uses Java, but I opted to use C++ instead.

1) Strategy pattern
2) Observer pattern
